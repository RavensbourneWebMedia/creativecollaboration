# Creative Collaboration 2017 

As its names suggests, this unit is all about collaboration. The web and photography industries often work together to make innovative campaigns and rebrands. The ability to work effectively in a team is vital for anyone wanting to make a career in either industry. This unit will not only test your ability to work with others, it will help to develop your ability to work with students from another course, in this case the Digital Photography course. To do that, you will have to understand the world of photography more deeply.


In particular, you will learn: 

* Art direction
* Rebranding 
* Working in teams 
* SEO 
* Advanced wordpress

**The brand identity could include:**

* Photography 
* Logo 
* Taglines 
* Social Media 
* Typography
* Web Banners 
* Colorscheme 
* Language

<img src="https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/creativecollaboration/blob/2017/assets%20/stockphoto.jpg" width="900">


Your goal for this project is to collaborate with students from Web Media and Design & Coding to produce a live photo library. You will work in a team (appointed by your tutors) to undertake this project. You will research libraries, analyse market trends and niche subject gaps that you can fill. 
You will then begin to produce content for this library which will be built by your partners from Web Media and Design & Coding.


### Project Report 

Within this report you are requested to critically reflect on your contribution and role within this project. Explain what you learnt from collaborating with others and what successes came out of the project. Also explain what you could have improved on as a group and independently. Within the report please also summarise the approach you took to develop the content for the website and the overall outcome. Include the strategy you adopted, what influences and references you took to develop the look and feel of the site, how you would use the project experience to enhance your on- and offline profile, what you learned about the process, plus how you would price yourself for a future, similar freelance job (your day rate).

# Learning Goals 

# Rules of the road

* **Be present**. If you happen to be late or absent, make sure you email me about it before a session starts. We'll deduct 2% from your grade for each uncommunicated tardiness or absence (aka the *2% Tardiness Tax*).
* **Participate** in class debates and workshops. We'll make sure that your ideas have space to be heard and that nobody makes you feel uncomfortable about sharing them.
* **Present** your work during formative and summative assessments. If you can't make it those days then you'll record your presentation and upload it to YouTube (or similar).
* **Be responsible** for what happens in class. Organise with your peers to get class information and material that you may have missed.
* **Meet the deadlines**. If you submit your work after a deadline, your grade will be capped at D- (bare pass).
