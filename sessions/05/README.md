# Week 5

### Today, Monday 30th October 2017

Pitch to Millennium Images 09.00 - 11.30

This is when you pitch and present your site to Jason Shenai & everyone needs to be in class by 09.00. Arriving late becomes a distraction for those people presenting so if you aren't in class on time you will have to wait in the corridor until a suitable break.

Do this with your Web Media partners.

Make sure that you rehearse in advance

Afterwards there will be scheduled Tutorials - in teams

12.00 - 12.30 - Team 1
12.30 - 13.00 - Team 2
13.00 - 13.30 - Team 3
13.30 - 14.00 - Team 4
14.00 - 14.30 - Team 5
