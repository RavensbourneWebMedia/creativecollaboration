# Week 5

### Today, Monday 30th October 2017

Pitch to Millennium Images 09.00 - 11.30

This is when you pitch and present your site to Jason Shenai & everyone needs to be in class by 09.00. Arriving late becomes a distraction for those people presenting so if you aren't in class on time you will have to wait in the corridor until a suitable break.

Do this with your Digital Photography partners.

Make sure that you rehearse in advance

Afterwards there will be scheduled Tutorials - in teams
* 12.00 - 12.30 - Team 1 Roots - Callum (c.lovekin@students.rave.ac.uk)
* 12.30 - 13.00 - Team 2 Patch - Mayur (m.soneji@students.rave.ac.uk)
* 13.00 - 13.30 - Team 3 Froodle - Domonic (d.bishop@students.rave.ac.uk)
* 13.30 - 14.00 - Team 4 Glaze - Emma (e.roberts@students.rave.ac.uk)
* 14.00 - 14.30 - Team 5 Linear - Kaleshe (k.alleyne-vassel@students.rave.ac.uk)
