# Week 5

### Today, Monday 6th November 2017

Having pitched your Picture Library plan to Millennium Images in Week 5 you should now be refining your concept based on the feedback that you received & starting to undertake the photography that will generate the web sites content.

Each team should be uploading their files to the common G Drive for everyone to access.

Make this drive accessible to you everyone, even your tutors.

You should be out generating material for this unit now & at the same time developing your ideas in your DWB as well as showing your pre-production & planning, influences, inspirations, etc.
