# Introduction to brief

As its names suggests, this unit is all about collaboration. The web and photography industries often work together to make innovative campaigns and rebrands. The ability to work effectively in a team is vital for anyone wanting to make a career in either industry. This unit will not only test your ability to work with others, it will help to develop your ability to work with students from another course, in this case the Digital Photography course. To do that, you will have to understand the world of photography more deeply.

### Project A: Change by Design (Led by Web Media and Design&Coding students)


Each group will be allocated an iconic brand to explore and refresh. Whatever the brand, you must take a 360 degree approach.

A 360 degree approach means thinking holistically about the brand identity and how it translates across different mediums/sizes.


**The brand identity could include:**

* Photography
* Logo
* Taglines
* Social Media
* Typography
* Web Banners
* Colorscheme
* Language
* Target group
* Subway banners etc


### Project B: Picture library (Led by photography students)

<img src="https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/creativecollaboration/blob/2017/assets%20/stockphoto.jpg" width="900">


Your goal for this project is to collaborate with students from Web Media and Design & Coding to produce a live photo library. You will work in a team (appointed by your tutors) to undertake this project. You will research libraries, analyse market trends and niche subject gaps that you can fill.
You will then begin to produce content for this library which will be built by your partners from Web Media and Design & Coding.


### Project Report

Within this report you are requested to critically reflect on your contribution and role within this project. Explain what you learnt from collaborating with others and what successes came out of the project. Also explain what you could have improved on as a group and independently. Within the report please also summarise the approach you took to develop the content for the website and the overall outcome. Include the strategy you adopted, what influences and references you took to develop the look and feel of the site, how you would use the project experience to enhance your on- and offline profile, what you learned about the process, plus how you would price yourself for a future, similar freelance job (your day rate).

**Length: 1500 words**

### Team allocation

[Here is a link to the google doc with the teams and brands](https://docs.google.com/a/rave.ac.uk/spreadsheets/d/1xu1WENCZlZizewKf2SAKWLoxGtug986qIJ4Tc5bXZiY/edit?usp=sharing)


**The next section only concerns Design&Coding and Web Media students.**

# Homework

**Peer learning**: [one of the most effective ways](http://visible-learning.org/hattie-ranking-influences-effect-sizes-learning-achievement/hattie-ranking-teaching-effects/) to learn something is to teach it to someone else. During this unit you'll be sharing your skills and knowledge in class, leading mini-tutorials and moderating debates. Starting with [your homework for next week](#peer-learning-research)!

# Blog

Keeping a **journal** to record your creative process is extremely important. Don't let your ideas and thoughts fade away! Think of your blog as your *digital sketchbook* (more on that [here](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/Blogging#why-blogging)). We ask you to blog regularly and we'll check that you do it every week.

**What is the biggest challenge with teamwork?**

Working in teams can be a real challenge. Therefore, I would like you to reflect on the biggest challenges that you find by working in teams and what some of ways to address these issues might be.
